# 112TermProject

Pokemon 112 is a pokemon clone which randomly generates terrain for you to play
on. You start with a pokemon and defeat other pokemon in battle when moving 
around to catch them. Once you have won a certain amount of round, you win!
Make sure not to lose too many though, getting all your pokemons' hp to 0
causes a wipeout! Check your bag to see the stats of your pokemon as well,
and also get randomly generated character. 

Credits are found in the credits.txt file!

Run the project by running main.py in an editor.

The csv library is used.
